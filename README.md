# Cerritos-Consulting-Project
Statistical consultation project for Cerritos College.

This project is the culmination of my graduate program in statistics. I worked with two peers to analyze the effectiveness of the tutoring program at Cerritos College on student success outcomes. My code is in the "My Code" folder, data from the college is in the "Data from Cerritos" folder, and tables used for analysis are located in the "Data Tables" folder. The root directory contains the final report. All code is in R.
