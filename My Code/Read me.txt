Within the chemistry and math folders, tables are created that include information on non-embedded math and chem students for fall terms 2019-2023. These tables are combined into master tables in the “table.construct” file. The “add.course.info” file removes non-embedded students taking more than one course per-semester and adds course information to remaining students in both the embedded and non-embedded (general) student data tables to facilitate comparison between general and embedded student performance. The “modeling.tests” file includes some experimentation with modeling and data manipulation, as well as variable selection via Random Forest. The “preliminary.models” file includes additional experimentation, including “collapsing” of a few variables and addition of prior term GPA. The “final.models” file includes Propensity Score Matching, the final logistic regression models on the matched data, predicted probability plots, and some additional EDA.
