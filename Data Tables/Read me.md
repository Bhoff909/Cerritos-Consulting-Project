●	In the root folder, general.math.csv includes all non-embedded math students from fall 2019 to fall 2023. As some of these students took more than one math class per semester, pass rate is a continuous variable. Persistence and retention are binary.
●	Within the general/embedded math subfolder is the embedded math data table, which includes course information. The general math data table omits students taking multiple classes in order to facilitate the retrieval of course information and comparison with embedded students. All outcomes of interest are binary.
●	Within the general/embedded chem subfolder is the general chem data table, which omits students taking multiple classes in order to facilitate the retrieval of course information and comparison with embedded students.
